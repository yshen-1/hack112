# 3D Missile Command

Pretty much what it says on the tin. This is a variant of the popular 80s game
Missile Command, except in 3D. Players have to defend a 3D globe from missiles,
aided by a basic radar screen. Defense missiles are launched by clicking on the
screen, and the game view can be rotated by the arrow keys.
